# Naive simple pitch detection

I whipped this app up to start experimenting with pitch detection, and also to test live audio input.  It performs a naive (zero-crossing based) pitch detection algorithm in realtime.  It works best today with whistling (which has a clear, simple waveform); it needs some severe help with more complex waveforms, even like guitar.  I'll get back to this eventually.  :)  There are much better tuners out there right now - like [Craig Spence's work](http://phenomnomnominal.github.com/).

Check it out, feel free to fork, submit pull requests, etc.
